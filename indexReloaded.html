            <h1>Analyzing Stack Overflow Users</h1>
          <p>
            Stack Overflow has grown to one of the most popular websites not only for computer scientists, but also for the public of coders.
            Since it became a very important tool for developers we want to analyze the community as such and their evolution.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this visualization we aim to identify which kind of users contribute to the community, what and how much they contribute.
            Who keeps the platform running? How does user behavior change over time? These are few of the questions which will be dealt with in this visualization.
          </p>

          <p>
            The dataset used for this post was provided on archive.org by Stack Exchange themselves and contains information up to September 2017.
            It contains almost every information of the Stack Exchange websites. The following details of the dataset were used for this post:
            <ul>
              <li>
                User Information: Name, creation date, reputation
              </li>
              <li>
                Questions: User, votes, accepted answer
              </li>
              <li>
                Answers: User, votes, question
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            In each step of this post different facts about the community and their evolution will be presented and analyzed.
          </p>

            To give you a relation and better understanding of the community you will be able to observe yourself in most of the following visualizations.
            Your information will be highlighted in green.

          <p>
            In the first step we want to have a look at the users who form the community of Stack Overflow.
            How many users are asking questions? How many inactive users are they?
          </p>
          <p>
            The dataset has shown that there exist large discrepancies between users.
            Some users have never posted anything, some posted several hundreds of answers.
          </p>

          <select class="custom-select float-right" id="SelectHist">
              <option value="Reputation" selected>Reputation</option>

          </i></p>

          <p>
            We will now use the information extracted from the dataset to apply a classification of users into different user groups.
          </p>

          <h1>User Classification</h1>
          <p>
            We have built a classifier based on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/whats-reputation">reputation</a>.
            Reputation contains not only our calculated features and is therefore well suited to measure activity on the platform.
          </p>

          <p>
            One can notice that there exist a class with several million users. Their reputation has not changed at all since their registration.
            On the other side there is a group of users who are outperforming with a reputation of hundred thousand.
          </p>

          <canvas id="chart-class" height="100vh"></canvas>

          <p>
            Now that we have classified our users with Reputation, let's have a look at the other features of them.
          </p>

          <h1>Classified Users</h1>
          <p>
            Using the classification, we can now calculate the average features per class, to identify what our classes describe.
          </p>

          <p>
            One can notice that the users in the first class are people how created an account but never used it.
            Most users out of the second category used their account to ask a question, and even some answered a question.
            Users of the third class are more active. They receive more votes, ask several questions and post several answers.
            The fourth group is even more active. They asked more questions, but they are answering twice as much questions as they ask.
            Finally, the users in the last class answer a lot of questions. If they ask questions, they ask important ones.
          </p>

              <p>
                Since we can notice that users of the lower two classes are not active on Stack Overflow, we will now focus on the active classes.

          <p>
            Now that we got a basic understanding which kind of users our classes define, let's have a look at how the collected feature are correlated.
            This chart focuses on individual users (a sub selection) instead of averages.
          </p>

          <p>
            On one hand one can observe that the classification heavily depends on the answers posted by users.
            Users who post more answers gain a higher average vote per answer and gain more reputation.
            On the other hand, the classification does not work well for questions.
            No explicit trend between reputation and questions can be observed.
            Users are asking a different number of questions with different votes.
          </p>


          <div id="div-cordinates">

            </i>
          </p>

          <p>
            We found out that there exist different types of users and their contribution.
            But on which users does the community rely and how did Stack Overflow to this state?

          <p>
            In this step we will focus on the content created by the different user groups.
            Therefore, we calculated the portion of questions and answers posted by each user class per year.
          </p>

          <p>
            One can notice that Super Users and Frequent Users were asking a high portion of questions.
            These portions decreased heavily in the following years from more than 80% to less than 40% nowadays.
            Super Users today are only asking 5% of the questions. Most questions are asked by less active users. <br/>
            Like the questions Super Users and Frequent Users answered a high portion of questions.
            But the evolution of answers behaves differently.
            Nowadays they are still answering 65% of the questions of the whole community, while being less than 2% of users!

          <p>
            Stack Overflow heavily relies on answers. No one would visit Stack Overflow if he could not find answers.
            Since we observed that these answers are posted by Super Users and Frequent Users we were interested on their evolution.

            To answer these questions, we focused on the evolution of users over time.
            Therefore, the number of questions asked was plotted linked to the number of answers posted.

          <p>
            One can notice that for all users the number of questions asked increases.

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p>
              Throughout the visualizations we have shown that there exist different types of users: inactive, active and very active users.
              Questions on Stack Overflow are nowadays asked by every active user.
              Answers, on the other side, are posted by very active users.
              They contribute 65% of the answers, while being a minority of 2%!
          </p>

          <p>
              Furthermore, the visualizations showed that Stack Overflow content shifted over time.
              Super Users were asking many more questions than today.
              Nowadays they spend their time answering questions asked by less frequent users.
          </p>

          <p>
            Last but not least we were able to observe the growth of super users: <br/>
            Super Users shifted from asking questions to answering hundreds.
          </p>

          <p>
            Remembering that we did not spend a single word on non-registered users, makes the contribution of active users even more impressive.
            According to <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/stackoverflow.com#trafficCard">Quantcast</a>, Stack Overflow has almost 50 Million unique visitors per month!

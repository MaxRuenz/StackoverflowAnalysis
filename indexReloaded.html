            <h1>Analysing StackOverflow Users</h1>
            <p>
              StackOverflow has grown to one of the most popular websites not only for computer scienists, but also for the genreal public of coders.
              Since it became a very important tool for developers we want to analyse the community as such an their evolution.
            <p>

            <p>
              In this visualisation we aim to identify which kind of users contribute to the community, what and how much they contribute.
              Who keeps the platform running? How does user behavoir change over time? These are few of the questions which will be dealt with in this visualisation.
            </p>

            <p>
              The dataset used for this post was provided on archive.org by StackExchange themselves and contains information up to September 2017.
              It contains almost every information of the StackExchange websites. The following details of the dataset were used for this post:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  User Information: Name, creation date, reputation
                  Questions: User, votes, accepted answer
                  Answer: User, votes, question
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              Each of the different steps of this post will do a deeper analysis of StackOverflow
            </p>

            <h1>Different users</h1>
            <p>
              In the first step we want to have a look at the users who form the community of StackOverflow.
              How many users are asking questions? How many inactive users are they?
            </p>
            <p>
              The dataset has shown that there exist large descrepancies between users.
              Some users have never posted anything, some posted several hundreds of answers.
            </p>

            <select class="custom-select float-right" id="SelectHist">
                <option value="Reputation" selected>Reputation</option>
                <option value="Answers">Answers</option>

                <option value="Answer Votes">Answer Votes</option>
                <option value="Question Votes">Question Votes</option>

            <p>
              We will now use the information extracted from the dataset to apply a classification of users into different user groups.
            </p>

            <h1>User Classifiation</h1>
            <p>
              We have built a classifier based on reputation[link].
              Reputation contains our calculated features and more and is therefore well suited to measure activity on the platform.
            </p>

            <p>
              One can notice that there exist a class with several million users with a reputation which has not changed at all.
              On the other side there is a group of users who are contributing a lot.
            </p>

            <canvas id="chart-class" height="100vh"></canvas>

            <p>
              Now that we have classified our users with Reputation, let's have a look at the other features of them.
            </p>

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="carousel-item">

          <div class="carousel-caption text-left fullscreen">
            <h1>Classified Users</h1>
            <p>
              Using the classification we can now calcuate the average features per class, in order to identify what our classes actually describe.
            </p>

            <p>
              One can notice that the users in the fist class are people how created an account but never used it.
              Most users out of the second category used their account to ask a question, and even some answered a question.
              Users of the third class are definetly more active. They receive more votes, ask several questions and post several answers.
              The fourth group is even more active. They asked more questions, but they are answering twice as much questions as they ask.
              Finally the users in the last class are answering many questions, but if they ask questions, they ask imporant ones.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now that we got a basic understanding which kind of users our classes define, let's have a look at individual users.
              In this chart a subselection of users is displayed.
            </p>

            <p>
              One can observe that the classificaion heavily depends on the answers posted by users.
              Users who post more answers gain a higher average vote per answer and gain more reputation.
              On the other hand the classifiation does not work well for questions.
              Users are asking a different number of questions with different votes.
